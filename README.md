# Stock-analysis

## Project Overview

### Background

Analysis of pricing for individual stocks over time as well as trading volume is a data- and time-intensive task to attempt to perform manually. There are multiple forms of data, and the sheer number of daily trades makes it impractical to perform any sort of manual analysis of a group of stocks over time. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to assist our good friend Steve (side note: if he's fresh out of school himself, how did he earn a a finance degree without these skills? He should obviously enroll in a Data Bootcamp) in presenting his parents with key information on stocks of interest to them (in this case green energy-focused stocks). With 3,000+ rows of data showing daily information for twelve separate companies' stock for both 2017 and 2018, it would be impossible for Steve or his parents to have a good grasp of any optimal investment strategies without further data analysis.

## Results

Previous work in this module has allowed us to develop code that would present the annual information for each of the twelve stocks, particularly the total daily volume of trades, as well as the annual return based on year start and year end prices. The total daily volume provides context on how many trades have been executed over each year. As noted in the module text, a higher volume indicates higher certainty of pricing. The annual return provided for 2017 and 2018 give a history of the performance of each stock (though we all know that as a fiduciary Steve should be very quick to point out to his parents that past performance is not indicative of future returns). 

The following two images demonstrate the output from running the analysis for all stocks by year for 2017 and 2018, as we developed for the asynchronous module course work:
